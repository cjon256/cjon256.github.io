		<p>Shared mutable state causes problems, so we have to be very careful with it.</p>
<h2 id="networks">Networks</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a network admin at a small web host for over a decade. Started with
Foundry, did Cisco Cat6500 for far too long, and then switched to Juniper (MX
and QFX primarily).  When I started I was a hybrid programmer/sysadmin/netadmin
because the company was less than 10 people. Slowly my role became more and more
network focused because I was the only one who really &ldquo;understood that stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well that, and  other things. The clean separation between config and state in network devices
always seemed much nicer and cleaner than the sysadmin environment. And getting
involved with programming in that environment was less appealing because the company was PHP based,
and&hellip; PHP of that era was not to my taste. It&rsquo;s still one of my least favorite
languages, but I do hear it is much improved.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>And then it slowly shifted back to my needing all 3 hats as we got servers to
monitor, so SysAdmin again. And automation was required as we scaled up so that
brought back the programmer bit.</p>
<h2 id="containers">Containers</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Containers provide a standard way to package application&rsquo;s code and dependencies into a single object
&amp;emdash; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/deep-dive-containers/">AWS Deep Dive Containers</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the SysAdmin world has shifted a good bit thanks to containers. The
separation between config and more transitory state is much better. And the
automation tools are similar to what we use on the network side.</p>
<p>This means that being a sysadmin is really just as clean as being a netadmin,
which is a huge improvement.</p>

<p>This is probably unfair. The same thing happened to me with Java when it
first came out and I ended up working with applets. Not a good experience. But
as a result I also regard Java among my least favorite languages. I can at least
read Java and only feel mildly nauseated though, a much less visceral reaction
than PHP.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
