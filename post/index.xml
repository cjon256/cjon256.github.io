      <description>Networks State is at the bottom of almost all our problems when it comes to computer systems.
Some people would point to concurrency, but concurrency without state is trivial.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a network admin at a small web host for over a decade. Started with Foundry, did Cisco Cat6500 for far too long, and then switched to Juniper (MX and QFX primarily). When I started I was a hybrid programmer/sysadmin/netadmin because the company was less than 10 people.</description>

      <description>So quotes like this annoy me
 The immutable server pattern: Once code has been committed in Git, we don&amp;rsquo;t want anything else to change.
  The GitOps Pipeline - Part 2  the thing is, it oversimplifies.
There is some state anytime your code runs. What they mean is immutable is configuration, (by which I mean state that persists between runs).
There are, it seems to me, three distinct sources of persistent state.</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fizzbuzz&#34;&gt;FizzBuzz&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large percentage of programmers are probably familiar with the FizzBuzz
problem. This post was inspired by a solution that sent me contemplating what
makes a given piece of code easy or hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
